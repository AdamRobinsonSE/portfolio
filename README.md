## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on makng a simple, clean, and responsive site.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

When I improve this project I want to add gifs as the projects opposed to static images

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned is how awesome font awesome is. I wondered for a long time (too long!) how to get those icons for linkedin, github, etc. A simple google search and I stumbled upon it!
